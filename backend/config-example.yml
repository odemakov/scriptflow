# valid id: only lowercase letters, starts with letter a-z, contains only a-z0-9 and -, has at least 6 chars

# Schedule formats:
#   Cron:     "*/5 * * * *"     - standard 5-field cron
#   Duration: "@every 5m"       - runs with ~10% jitter to spread load
#
# Jenkins-style H (hash) notation for load distribution:
#   "H * * * *"        - run once per hour at consistent minute (0-59)
#   "H(0-30) * * * *"  - run once per hour between minute 0-30
#   "H H * * *"        - run once per day at consistent hour and minute
#
# H is deterministic per task - same task always runs at same time.
# Different tasks get distributed across the range based on task ID hash.
